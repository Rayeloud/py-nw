# Planning

## 0. SOTA and Methodology relecture
- State of the art
    - Transparent conducting materials
    - Morphological instability
    - Phase field formulation
- Methodology
    - Phase field model
    - Numerical method
    - Numerical Experiments
    - Nanowire case

## 1. Results : Free Standing Nanowire
- Finish non-dimensionalisation steps
- Plot dependency to non-dimensional parameters
    - The wavelength of instability : $\Lambda=\frac{\lambda}{L^*} = f(R_1, L_1, L^*, T^*, E^*,\dots)$
    - The time of first breakup : $\Tau=\frac{\tau}{T^*} = f(R_1, L_1, L^*, T^*, E^*,\dots)$
- Geometrical consideration
    - Comparison between cylindrical and pentagonal shapes (same derivation and discussion)
- Discuss w.r.t. references

## 2. Results : Nanowire on substrate
- Theory of Smooth Boundary Method (SBM)
    - Mathematical and physical origin
- Modified Cahn-Hilliard Equation
    - Implementation
    - Validation on simple case (coarsening of circular domain on flat surface in 2D)
- Modeling of Nanowire on substrate
    - Choice of contact angle, discussion
- Results and comparison with free-standing case
    - Cylindrical case (outer surface = const, diameter = const)
    - Pentagonal case (outer surface = const, diameter = const)
- Comparison with McCallum model

## 3. Conclusion
- Compile results and answer research question formally (feasability and relevency of phase field modeling for nanowire breakups)
- Perspectives and limitations of the presented approach (Coupled Cahn-Hilliard and Allen-Cahn, FEM with adaptive mesh refinement, decoupled Cahn-Hilliard)
