This third chapter investigates the dynamics of morphological instability by extending the results on the free-standing nanowire configuration. First, a non-dimensional analysis is performed on the model equation to shed light on the influence of the different characteristic physical parameters on the parameters of interest i.e.\ the breakup time $t_b$ and the wavelength of the instability $\lambda$. Extending on the work of Roy et al.\ \cite{RoyVarmaGururajan2021}, two configurations are considered, a single free-standing nanowire and a junction made from two free-standing nanowires. Finally, a discussion on the geometrical consideration is performed. The influence of the nanowire initial shape, is presented to close the gap between the numerical approximation and the experimental observations.
