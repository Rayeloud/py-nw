\label{chap:2_4-nanowire}
In this section, the implemented model is used to reproduce a selection of results presented in Roy et al.\ \cite{RoyVarmaGururajan2021} which studied surface-enhanced breakups in free-standing nanowires. The goal is to further validate the presented implementation in the case of 3D phase separation, and particular in the case of the nanowire morphological instability presented in \cite{RoyVarmaGururajan2021}.
\subsection{Free standing nanowire model}
    The nanowire is approximated as a free-standing infinitely long cylinder of radius $R_1$. The physical domain is shown in \autoref{fig:2-free-standing-nw}. In addition, two configurations are considered, a single wire and a junction of two wires with an intersection angle of $\theta$. The geometry of the problem is constructed using the \texttt{gmsh} software\ \cite{GeuzaineRemacle}.\\
    The order parameter $c$ in the phase-field model is defined as an indicator of wether a point belongs to the nanowire, the interface or the vacuum,
    \begin{equation}
        c(\mathbf{x}, t) = \begin{cases}
            1 & \text{if } \mathbf{x}\ \text{in NW bulk}, \\
            0.5 & \text{if } \mathbf{x}\ \text{on the interface}, \\
            0 & \text{if } \mathbf{x}\ \text{in vacuum bulk}.
        \end{cases}
    \end{equation}
    The contribution from the thermal annealing is modelled by adding a small stochastic perturbation to the order parameter $c$ in the initial condition \cite{BallFinkBowler2003}.
    \begin{equation}
        c(\mathbf{x}, 0) = \texttt{make\_composition\_field()} + c_{noise}(0.5-\texttt{RAND()})\ ,
    \end{equation}
    with \texttt{make\_composition\_field()} the function which perform the voxelisation algorithm of the prescribed geomtry, $c_{noise}$ the amplitude of the stochastic perturbation and $\texttt{RAND()}$ a random number generator.\\
    The Cahn-Hilliard equation solves the dynamics of a conserved order parameter $c$. Thus using this description, mass conservation is ensured as recalled in \autoref{chap:1_3-phase-field}. In addition, the total free energy is minimized when the system reaches equilibrium. The dynamics implemented being surface-driven by design of $M(c)$, the minimization of the total free energy leads to the minimization of the surface energy of the rods.\\
    %The phase field approach thus provide the same assumptions as McCallum and Plateau-Rayleigh albeit in a more general framework.

    \end{figure}
\subsection{Voxelisation}
    As previously mentioned in \autoref{chap:2_2-numerical_method}, the physical domain must be discretized as a regular grid. However, the geometry of the problem being complex, a voxelisation algorithm, i.e. a conversion of the defined geometry into a regular grid, is employed. The voxelisation is performed by first defining a coarse unregular mesh in \texttt{gmsh} and then performing an octree search to find elements which are inside the prescribed volume of the nanowire. The voxelised nanowire is shown in \autoref{fig:2-voxels}.
    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{chap2/2-voxel.png}
        \caption{Voxelisation of the single nanowire geometry. (a) Side view (b) Cross-section of the voxelised geometry compared to the actual geometry (dark grey). Visualization performed in \texttt{Paraview}.}
        \label{fig:2-voxels}
    \end{figure}
    The voxelisation is not perfect and close attention to the discretisation of the grid is required. This is mainly due to the initial coarse mesh which can sometimes lead to additional mislabeled grid points. This argument is all the more crucial when the geometry of the nanowire is more complex, which is further detailed in \autoref{chap:3-results}. 
\subsection{Results and comparison}
    Prior to the presentation of the results of the study, the implemented method is compared to the results presented in Roy et al. \cite{RoyVarmaGururajan2021}. This verification was performed on both, the single wire and the junction, configurations. The simulation paramters used for these battery of tests are presented in \autoref{tab:2-parameters}. For the sake of clarity, the non-dimensionalisation steps of the parameters are detailed in \autoref{chap:3-results}.
    %Before presenting the main results, reproduction of the results presented in Roy et al.\ \cite{RoyVarmaGururajan2021} is performed on the two configurations i.e.\ single wire and junction. The non-dimensionalisation steps of the parameters are detailed in \autoref{chap:3-results} for the sake of clarity. The simulation parameters used are the following.

    \end{table}
    \subsubsection{Single wire}
    The breakups of both infinitely long and finite single free-standing nanowires are respectively shown in \autoref{fig:2-single-wire}. The results of the breakup are in good agreement with Roy's. 
    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{chap2/2-single-nw.png}
        \caption{Single free-standing nanowire simulation from (A) the implemented model (B) Roy et al. at (a) $t=500$ (b) $t=1500$ (c) $t=2700$ (d) $t=2800$. The initial radii are both $R=R_1$.\ \cite{RoyVarmaGururajan2021}.}
        \label{fig:2-single-wire}
    \end{figure}
    Indeed, the free ends of the finite nanowire retract and bulge out. As the ends retracts, necking starts to form which then lead to the breakup of the nanowire into a series of spherical chunks. In addition, the spherical chunks are not of the same size, due to the coarsening of the wire. In the case of the infinitely long nanowire, the wire starts by coarsening until the instabilities grow sufficiently to induce necking and subsequent breakup of the nanowire.
    The fragmentation in a series of spherical chunk observed in both simulations is in good agreement with the literature recalled in \autoref{chap:1-sota}. Nichols and Mullins predicted that free-standing rods breakup into a series of chunks due to the surface energy minimization. The fragmentation is mediated by the maximally growing wavelength $\lambda$ of the inital perturbation.

    \subsubsection{Junction}
    The breakups in the junction configuration are presented in \autoref{fig:2-junction}. The observed evolution in good agreement with the results obtained in \cite{RoyVarmaGururajan2021}. 
    \begin{figure}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{chap2/2-junction.png}

The slight differences between frames (e) and (f) are due to the stochastic nature of the initial condition.}
        \label{fig:2-junction}
    \end{figure}
    The proximity between the two nanowires leads to local sintering. In addition, necking occurs at the location of the junction on each nanowire as shown in \autoref{fig:2-junction-zoom}. As the wires coarsen and the instabilities grow, further necking is observed at the junction which lead to the breakup of the junction, leaving behind a spherical chunk. Afterwards, the free ends of the broken junction retracts and bulge out, leading to the formation of spherical chunks. This highlights two distinct mechanisms, the initial breakup of the junction into a central chunk and the subsequent breakup of the free ends. The free ends breakup is similar to the one observed in the single wire configuration.

    The implemented model is thus able to reproduce the results presented in Roy et al. \cite{RoyVarmaGururajan2021}. In the following chapter, the study performed by Roy et al. is extended by first discussing the influence of the non-dimensionalisition of the parameters on the dynamics. Then, thanks to the implemented voxelisation algorithm, the influence of the initial shape of the nanowire is studied.
