\subsection{Theoretical context}
    Free boundary problem description in diffusion problem at microscale. Langer proposed an approach which he initially though to complex to be useful. However, years later with the technological advances made in computers, this approach became the standard when studying microstructural evolution, the phase field modeling theory. In 1959, Cahn and Hilliard continued and expanded on Langer initial work and developed what is refered to now as the Cahn-Hiliard equation. This equation is a fourth order partial differential equation which describes the evolution of a conserved order parameter, refered to as the phase field, in a system described by a free energy functional.
