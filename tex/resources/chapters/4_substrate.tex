In this fourth and final chapter, an extension of the Cahn-Hilliard equation is presented to model the influence of a flat substrate on which the nanowires are deposited. First, the geometry of the problem is defined. Afterwards, the modified Cahn-Hilliard equation is detailed by introducing the concept of Smooth Boundary MethodÂ (\cite{YuChenThornton2009}\nocite{YuChenThornton2012}\nocite{SinhababuBhattacharya2022}\nocite{YangWangKim2022}--\cite{LiChoiKim2016}) and how a contact angle condition is implemented. After the implementation is validated, an brief discussion on how the condition can accurately model the influence of the substrate in the case of nanowire morphological instability is presented. Finally, a comparative analysis is performed, comparing the results between the free-standing and the substrate-influenced configurations.
