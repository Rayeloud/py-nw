% This first chapter introduces the required theoretical tools needed to study the morphological instability of metallic nanowire. The first section is dedicated to the introduction of the concept of transparent conducting materials/electrodes (TCM/Es) and more specially metallic nanowire-based TCEs. Metallic nanowire networks are then compared to transparent conducting oxides, the industry leading transparent conducting materials nowadays. Afterwards, a review of the different type of electrical activation methods are discussed with a focus on thermal annealing which shed light on the thermal instability of such metallic nanonetworks. The thermal instability leads to the morphological instability of the nanowires which is introduced in the second section. 
This first chapter introduces the theoretical tools needed to study the morphological instability of metallic nanowires numerically. To do so, three concepts are discussed.\\
First, the notion of metallic nanowires (MNWs) by introducing the concept of transparent conducting materials/electrodes, their field of applications and, in the case of MNWs, the different electrical activation methods used in practice, with a focus on thermal annealing. \\
In addition, the concept of morphological instability is discussed through the introduction of the thermal instability that metallic nanowires suffer, especially Ag-MNWs. This section covers the works of Plateau-Rayleigh in their first theoretical description of the phenomenon. \\
Finally, a detailed description of phase field modeling theory, the model utilised in this study, is performed.
