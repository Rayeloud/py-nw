% This first chapter introduces the required theoretical tools needed to study the morphological instability of metallic nanowire. The first section is dedicated to the introduction of the concept of transparent conducting materials/electrodes (TCM/Es) and more specially metallic nanowire-based TCEs. Metallic nanowire networks are then compared to transparent conducting oxides, the industry leading transparent conducting materials nowadays. Afterwards, a review of the different type of electrical activation methods are discussed with a focus on thermal annealing which shed light on the thermal instability of such metallic nanonetworks. The thermal instability leads to the morphological instability of the nanowires which is introduced in the second section.

This first chapter introduces the theoretical tools needed to study the morphological instability of metallic nanowires numerically. To do so, three concepts are discussed.\\
First, the notion of metallic nanowires (MNWs) within the broader context of transparent conducting materials and electrodes. This section begins by defining TCMs, discussing their various field of applications and introducing the relevant properties and a means to compare different types of TCMs through a Figure of Merit (FoM). The focus then shifts to metallic nanowires, emphasizing their advantages over the currently most used TCM, Indium-Tin Oxides (ITOs). Different electrical activation methods are then reviewed, with a particular focus on thermal annealing, which shed light on the thermal instability that takes place at the nanowire scale.\\
Following the introduction of the thermal instability, the second section focuses on the concept of morphological instability starting from the broad theoretical description first made by Plateau-Rayleigh in liquid-jets. The discrepancies between Plateau-Rayleigh predictions and what is observed experimentally are then discussed.\\
Finally, a detailed description of phase field modeling theory, the model utilized in this study, is provided by first introducing its emergence in microstuctural evolution studies and then detailing the mathematical formulation and the underlying physical principles.
