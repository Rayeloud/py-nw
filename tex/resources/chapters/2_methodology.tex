This second chapter aim is to introduce the methodology used throughout this work, i.e.\ the phase-field model utilized as well as its specifics. First, a section is dedicated to the employed Variable Mobility Cahn-Hilliard equation. Then, the numerical method used to implement the model is detailed. Afterwards, numerical experiments are performed using the now implemented model in order to asses its consistency and stability. The model solution are then compared to peer reviewed benchmark problems \cite{JokisaariVoorheesGuyerWarrenHeinonen2017} in order to validate the model. Finally, some preliminary results surface-enhanced breakups in nanowire are presented following the work of Roy et al.\cite{RoyVarmaGururajan2021} which will be further extended in \autoref{chap:3-results} and \autoref{chap:4-substrate}.
