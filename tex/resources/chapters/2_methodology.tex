This chapter aims at introducing the methodology used throughout this work, i.e.\ the phase-field model utilized as well as its specifics. First, a section is dedicated to the employed Variable Mobility Cahn-Hilliard equation. Then, the numerical method used to implement the model is detailed. Subsequently, numerical experiments are performed using the implemented model in order to asses its consistency and stability. The model solutions are then compared to peer-reviewed benchmark problems \cite{JokisaariVoorheesGuyerWarrenHeinonen2017} in order to validate the model. Finally, some typical results concerning surface-enhanced breakups in free-standing nanowires are presented as a direct follow-up to Roy et al.'s work \cite{RoyVarmaGururajan2021} which will be further extended in \autoref{chap:3-results} and \autoref{chap:4-substrate}.
