	title = {Phase-field study of surface diffusion enhanced break-ups of nanowire junctions},
	abstract = {Using a phase-field model which incorporates enhanced diffusion at the nanowire surfaces, we study the effect of different parameters on the stability of intersecting nanowires. Our study shows that at the intersection of nanowires, sintering (curvature driven material flow) leads to the formation of junctions. These junctions act the initiators of nanowire break-up. The subsequent break-ups take place due to Rayleigh instability at the arms away from these junctions. Finally, at long time scales, the fragments coarsen due to the differences in sizes. The radii of the nanowires that form the junction, the difference in size of the intersecting nanowires and the angle of intersection play a dominant role in determining the kinetics of break-up while the density of intersections has little or no effect on the ki-netics. We rationalise our results using maps of (i) mean curvatures (and, hence, chemical potentials), and, (ii) Interfacial Shape Distributions ({ISDs}) (which are based on probability densities associated with different combinations of the two principal curvatures). Finally, we use the moment of inertia tensor to characterise the (non-spherical) shapes and morphologies of (central) nanowire fragments at the junctions.},

The time variable is discretized by using semi-implicit schemes which allow much larger time step sizes than explicit schemes; the space variables are discretized by using a Fourier-spectral method whose convergence rate is exponential in contrast to second order by a usual finite-difference method. We have applied our method to predict the equilibrium profiles of an order parameter across a stationary planar interface and the velocity of a moving interface by solving the time-dependent Ginzburg—Landau equation, and compared the accuracy and efficiency of our results with those obtained by others. We demonstrate that, for a specified accuracy of 0.5\%, the speedup of using semi-implicit Fourier-spectral method, when compared with the explicit finite-difference schemes, is at least two orders of magnitude in two dimensions, and close to three orders of magnitude in three dimensions. The method is shown to be particularly powerful for systems in which the morphologies and microstructures are dominated by long-range elastic interactions.},

The logarithmic function has a singularity at zero. To remove the singularity, we regularize the function near zero by using a quadratic polynomial approximation. We perform a convergence test, a linear stability analysis, and a robustness test of the ternary Cahn-Hilliard equation. We observe that our numerical solutions are convergent, consistent with the exact solutions of linear stability analysis, and stable with practically large enough time steps. Using the proposed numerical scheme, we also study the temporal evolution of morphology patterns during phase separation in one-, two-, and three-dimensional spaces.},

To solve it, we split the solution into a volume potential computed with free space kernels, plus the solution to a second kind integral equation ({SKIE}). The volume potential is evaluated with the help of a box-based volume-{FMM} method. For non-box domains, the source density is extended by solving a biharmonic Dirichlet problem. The near-singular boundary integrals are computed using quadrature by expansion ({QBX}) with {FMM} acceleration.

	abstract = {Implicit-Explicit methods have been widely used for the efficient numerical simulation of phase field problems such as the Cahn-Hilliard equation or thin film type equations. Due to the lack of maximum principle and stiffness caused by the effect of small dissipation coefficient, most existing theoretical analysis relies on adding additional stabilization terms, mollifying the nonlinearity or introducing auxiliary variables which implicitly either changes the structure of the problem or trades accuracy for stability in a subtle way. In this work we introduce a robust theoretical framework to analyze directly the stability of the standard implicit-explicit approach without stabilization or any other modification. We take the Cahn-Hilliard equation as a model case and prove energy stability under natural time step constraints which are optimal with respect to energy scaling. These settle several questions which have been open since the work of Chen and Shen {\textbackslash}cite\{{CS}98\}.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a phase-field simulation of phase separation for a polymer/solvent system and aims at investigating in a systematic way the influence of the mobility model on the simulation results. In 2D geometry, the Flory-Huggins theory was used to describe the thermodynamics of the {PMMA}/cyclohexanol system and four mobility models were tested: a constant model, a slow model, a fast model and a mobility model based on the free-volume theory of Vrentas. The simulated patterns were analyzed by Fourier transform and using Minkowski descriptors. Growth laws deduced from a Fourier Transform of the patterns exhibited that the power laws were ranged between 1/5 and 1/3 depending on the quenching conditions (T and initial composition) and the mobility model. Using the Vrentas mobility model, growth laws of Lc∼t1/5, Lc∼t1/4 and Lc∼t1/3 were found for initial compositions in the range ϕinit=0.075, 0.140 and 0.200, respectively, whereas due to faster phase inversion dynamics, a growth law close to Lc∼t1/3 was simulated for the constant mobility model whatever the quenching conditions (T and initial composition), thus demonstrating the importance to choose an appropriate mobility model for simulating the phase separation of polymer/solvent system.},

	abstract = {Phase-field models are widely employed to simulate microstructure evolution during processes such as solidification or heat treatment. The resulting partial differential equations, often strongly coupled together, may be solved by a broad range of numerical methods, but this often results in a high computational cost, which calls for advanced numerical methods to accelerate their resolution. Here, we quantitatively test the efficiency and accuracy of semi-implicit Fourier spectral-based methods, implemented in Python programming language and parallelized on a graphics processing unit ({GPU}), for solving a phase-field model coupling Cahn-Hilliard and Allen-Cahn equations. We compare computational performance and accuracy with a standard explicit finite difference ({FD}) implementation with similar {GPU} parallelization on the same hardware. For a similar spatial discretization, the semi-implicit Fourier spectral ({FS}) solvers outperform the {FD} resolution as soon as the time step can be taken 5 to 6 times higher than afforded for the stability of the {FD} scheme. The accuracy of the {FS} methods also remains excellent even for coarse grids, while that of {FD} deteriorates significantly. Therefore, for an equivalent level of accuracy, semi-implicit {FS} methods severely outperform explicit {FD}, by up to 4 orders of magnitude, as they allow much coarser spatial and temporal discretization.},

	abstract = {We present and analyze a uniquely solvable and unconditionally energy stable numerical scheme for the ternary Cahn-Hilliard system, with a polynomial pattern nonlinear free energy expansion. One key difﬁculty is associated with presence of the three mass components, though a total mass constraint reduces this to two components. Another numerical challenge is to ensure the energy stability for the nonlinear energy functional in the mixed product form, which turns out to be non-convex, non-concave in the three-phase space. To overcome this subtle difﬁculty, we add a few auxiliary terms to make the combined energy functional convex in the three-phase space, and this, in turn, yields a convex-concave decomposition of the physical energy in the ternary system. Consequently, both the unique solvability and the unconditional energy stability of the proposed numerical scheme are established at a theoretical level. In addition, an optimal rate convergence analysis in the ∞(0, T ; {HN}−1) ∩ 2(0, T ; {HN}1 ) norm is provided, with Fourier pseudo-spectral discretization in space, which is the ﬁrst such result in this ﬁeld. To deal with the nonlinear implicit equations at each time step, we apply an efﬁcient preconditioned steepest descent ({PSD}) algorithm. A second order accurate, modiﬁed {BDF} scheme is also discussed. A few numerical results are presented, which conﬁrm the stability and accuracy of the proposed numerical scheme.},

	abstract = {We propose and analyze a first-order in time, second order in space finite difference scheme for the functionalized Cahn-Hilliard ({FCH}) equation with a logarithmic Flory-Huggins potential. The semi-implicit numerical scheme is designed based on a suitable convex-concave decomposition of the {FCH} free energy. We prove unique solvability of the numerical algorithm and verify its unconditional energy stability without any restriction on the time step size. Thanks to the singular nature of the logarithmic part in the Flory-Huggins potential near the pure states \$\${\textbackslash}pm 1\$\$, we establish the so-called positivity-preserving property for the phase function at a theoretic level. As a consequence, the numerical solutions will never reach the singular values \$\${\textbackslash}pm 1\$\$in the point-wise sense and the fully discrete scheme is well defined at each time step. Next, we present a detailed optimal rate convergence analysis and derive error estimates in \$\$l{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}infty \}(0,T;L\_h{\textasciicircum}2){\textbackslash}cap l{\textasciicircum}2(0,T;H{\textasciicircum}3\_h)\$\$under a linear refinement requirement \$\${\textbackslash}{varDelta} t{\textbackslash}le C\_1 h\$\$. To achieve the goal, a higher order asymptotic expansion (up to the second order temporal and spatial accuracy) based on the Fourier projection is utilized to control the discrete maximum norm of solutions to the numerical scheme. We show that if the exact solution to the continuous problem is strictly separated from the pure states \$\${\textbackslash}pm 1\$\$, then the numerical solutions can be kept away from \$\${\textbackslash}pm 1\$\$by a positive distance that is uniform with respect to the size of the time step and the grid. Finally, a few numerical experiments are presented. Convergence test is performed to demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed numerical scheme. Pearling bifurcation, meandering instability and spinodal decomposition are observed in the numerical simulations.},

	abstract = {A challenge in phase field modeling of phase-separating binary systems using the Cahn–Hilliard equation ({CHE}) is the determination of the mobility coefficient, which controls the kinetics of order parameter evolution. This work presents numerical simulations to assess the feasibility of determining mobility in the {CHE} from a notional, model experiment. The qualitative behavior of these simulations differentiates between a mobility that is uniform throughout the system and one that is restricted only to phase interfaces. Moreover, quantitative analysis of the proposed model experiment permits inference of the product of mobility and the coefficient of the uniform-free energy term as well the characteristic length of the {CHE}. If the free energy coefficient is determined by other means (e.g., form thermodynamic or atomistic models), then the mobility may be calculated, as well.},

This expression is used to determine the properties of a flat interface between two coexisting phases. In particular, we find that the thickness of the interface increases with increasing temperature and becomes infinite at the critical temperature Tc, and that at a temperature T just below Tc the interfacial free energy σ is proportional to (Tc−T)32.The predicted interfacial free energy and its temperature dependence are found to be in agreement with existing experimental data. The possibility of using optical measurements of the interface thickness to provide an additional check of our treatment is briefly discussed.},

	abstract = {A stabilized semi-implicit scheme was designed in [3] to solve the Functionalized Cahn-Hilliard ({CCH}) equation, but there is a lack of theoretical analysis of the energy stability. In this paper, we generalize this scheme to solve the general {FCH} mass-conserving gradient flow ({FCH}-{MCGF}) equation and show the theoretical analysis results about the unique solvability and energy stability. We successfully prove that this scheme is uniquely solvable and energy stable in theory by rewriting the double-well potential function to satisfy the Lipschitz-type condition. The range of stabilization parameters is theoretically given as well. In addition, another similar energy stable scheme is proposed, which slightly widens the range of stabilization parameters in theory and has almost the same precision as the previous one. Both the detailed numerical procedure and the selection of stabilization parameters are presented. Finally, several numerical experiments are performed for the {FCH}-{MCGF} equation based on these schemes. Specially, the adaptive time step size is considered in the scheme for the simulations of the phase separation in 2D and 3D, since any time step size can be used according to our theoretical results. Numerical results show that these schemes are energy stable and the large time step size indeed can be used in computations. Moreover, by comprehensive comparisons of stability and accuracy among the stabilized semi-implicit scheme, the convex splitting scheme, and the fully implicit scheme, we conclude that the performance of the stabilized semi-implicit scheme is the best, and the convex splitting scheme performs better than the fully implicit scheme.},

The ternary {CH} model has extensive applications in material and fluid fields. When the classical scalar auxiliary variable ({SAV}) method is used for the ternary {CH} problem, extra computational costs are needed because of the decoupling between local and non-local variables. The {MSAV} method considered in this study not only inherits the merits of classical {SAV} method, i.e., linear scheme and energy stability, but also allows simpler calculations. In one time iteration, we only need to solve a set of linear equations by a step-by-step procedure, thus the computation is highly efficient. To accelerate the convergence, a fast linear multigrid algorithm is adopted to solve the resulting discrete systems. Various numerical tests without and with fluid flows are performed to verify the good performance of the proposed methods.},

Here we use upscaled field equations and exploit the second law of thermodynamics in the spirit of rational thermodynamics to develop a framework that, for two phases at the macroscale, recovers the Korteweg stress tensor for the liquid phase, generalizes Darcy’s law, and recovers the classical Cahn-Hilliard equation. The corresponding results for three-phases at the macroscale are derived and are shown to be a generalization of Richards equation, and with appropriate simplifying assumptions are shown to recover the two-phase results. Simplifying the results appropriately produces a pore scale model for two liquid phases, and are shown to generalize previous works by Cueto-Felgueroso and Juanes and Boyer and Quintard et. al. The results are are also compared with the Cahn-Hilliard Brinkman equations, where it is noted that to be physically consistent the state variable should represent a physical quantity. One key aspect that distinguishes this formulation from others is that it captures the different energies of the three interfaces (gas-liquid, gas-solid, and liquid-solid) without introducing the corresponding quantities at the microscale (interfacial tension, contact angle, etc).},

	abstract = {Phase field theory is a promising framework for analyzing evolving microstructures in materials. Phenomena like those related to microstructures in Ni-based superalloys, twin structures in martensites or precipitation in Al-alloys can be predicted by phase field theory. While phase transformations such as those characterizing twinning are captured by an Allen-Cahn-type approach, a Cahn-Hilliard-type formulation is used, if the respective interface motion is driven by the concentration of the species. Although the Allen-Cahn and the Cahn-Hilliard formulation are indeed different, they do share some similarities. To be more precise, a Cahn-Hilliard model is obtained by enforcing balance of mass in the Allen-Cahn approach. Within an energy-based formulation this can be implemented by adding additional energy terms to the underlying Allen-Cahn energy. Such a universal energy-based framework is elaborated in this presentation. (© 2015 Wiley-{VCH} Verlag {GmbH} \& Co. {KGaA}, Weinheim)},

	abstract = {Modeling of ductile fracture in polycrystalline structures is challenging, since it requires integrated modeling of cracks, crystal plasticity, and grains. Here we extend the typical phase-field framework to the situations with constraints on the order parameters, and formulate two types of phase-field models on ductile fracture. The Type-I model incorporates three sets of order parameters, which describe the distributions of cracks, plastic strain, and grains, respectively. Crystal plasticity is employed within grain interiors accommodated by J2 plasticity at grain boundaries. The applications of the Type-I model to single crystals and bicrystals demonstrate the influences of grain orientations and grain boundaries on crack growth. In the Type-{II} model, J2 plasticity is assumed for the whole system and grain structures are neglected. Taking advantage of the efficiency of the fast Fourier transform, our Type-{II} model is employed to study low cycle fatigue.

	abstract = {Phase ﬁeld models, in particular, the Allen-Cahn type and Cahn-Hilliard type equations, have been widely used to investigate interfacial dynamic problems. Designing accurate, efﬁcient, and stable numerical algorithms for solving the phase ﬁeld models has been an active ﬁeld for decades. In this paper, we focus on using the deep neural network to design an automatic numerical solver for the Allen-Cahn and Cahn-Hilliard equations by proposing an improved physics informed neural network ({PINN}). Though the {PINN} has been embraced to investigate many differential equation problems, we ﬁnd a direct application of the {PINN} in solving phase-ﬁeld equations won’t provide accurate solutions in many cases. Thus, we propose various techniques that add to the approximation power of the {PINN}. As a major contribution of this paper, we propose to embrace the adaptive idea in both space and time and introduce various sampling strategies, such that we are able to improve the efﬁciency and accuracy of the {PINN} on solving phase ﬁeld equations. In addition, the improved {PINN} has no restriction on the explicit form of the {PDEs}, making it applicable to a wider class of {PDE} problems, and shedding light on numerical approximations of other {PDEs} in general.},

	abstract = {We study the dynamics of the one-dimensional ε-dependent Cahn-Hilliard / {AllenCahn} equation within a neighborhood of an equilibrium of N transition layers, that in general does not conserve mass. Two diﬀerent settings are considered which diﬀer in that, for the second, we impose a mass-conservation constraint in place of one of the zero-mass ﬂux boundary conditions at x = 1. Motivated by the study of Carr and Pego on the layered metastable patterns of Allen-Cahn in [10], and by this of Bates and Xun in [5] for the Cahn-Hilliard equation, we implement an N dimensional, and a mass-conservative N −1-dimensional manifold respectively; therein, a metastable state with N transition layers is approximated. We then determine, for both cases, the essential dynamics of the layers (ode systems with the equations of motion), expressed in terms of local coordinates relative to the manifold used. In particular, we estimate the spectrum of the linearized Cahn-Hilliard / Allen-Cahn operator, and specify wide families of ε-dependent weights δ(ε), µ(ε), acting at each part of the operator, for which the dynamics are stable and rest exponentially small in ε. Our analysis enlightens the role of mass conservation in the classiﬁcation of the general mixed problem into two main categories where the solution has a proﬁle close to Allen-Cahn, or, when the mass is conserved, close to the Cahn-Hilliard solution.},

However, it is still unknown if the phase-field models with Caputo time-fractional derivative preserve this property, which is challenging due to the existence of both nonlocality and nonlinearity. Our recent work shows that on the continuous level, the time-fractional energy dissipation law and the weighted energy dissipation law can be achieved. Inspired by them, we study in this article the energy dissipation of some numerical schemes for time-fractional phase-field models, including the convex-splitting scheme, the stabilization scheme, and the scalar auxiliary variable scheme. Based on a lemma about a special Cholesky decomposition, it can be proved that the discrete fractional derivative of energy is nonpositive, i.e., the discrete time-fractional energy dissipation law, and that a discrete weighted energy can be constructed to be dissipative, i.e., the discrete weighted energy dissipation law. In addition, some numerical tests are provided to verify our theoretical analysis.},

	abstract = {The nonlocal operator method ({NOM}) is based on nonlocal theory and employs nonlocal operators of integral form to replace the local partial differential operators. {NOM} naturally bridges models of different length scales and enables also the natural solution of problems with continuous to discontinuous solutions as they occur in the case of material failure. It also provides a natural framework for complex multifield problems. It is based on a variational principle or weighted residual method and only requires the definition of associated energy potential. As the {NOM} does not require any shape functions as ’traditional methods’ such as {FEM}, {IGA} or meshfree methods, its implementation is significantly simplified. It has been successfully applied to the solution of several partial differential equations ({PDEs}). This paper aims to provide a comprehensive description of the {NOM} together with a review of its major applications for the solution of {PDEs} for challenging engineering problems. Finally, we give some potential future research direction in the area of methods based on nonlocal operators.This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium provided the original work is properly cited.},

	abstract = {This article describes how the dimensions of nanowires affect the transmittance and sheet resistance of a random nanowire network. Silver nanowires with independently controlled lengths and diameters were synthesized with a gram-scale polyol synthesis by controlling the reaction temperature and time. Characterization of films composed of nanowires of different lengths but the same diameter enabled the quantification of the effect of length on the conductance and transmittance of silver nanowire films. Finite-difference time-domain calculations were used to determine the effect of nanowire diameter, overlap, and hole size on the transmittance of a nanowire network. For individual nanowires with diameters greater than 50 nm, increasing diameter increases the electrical conductance to optical extinction ratio, but the opposite is true for nanowires with diameters less than this size. Calculations and experimental data show that for a random network of nanowires, decreasing nanowire diameter increases the number density of nanowires at a given transmittance, leading to improved connectivity and conductivity at high transmittance ({\textgreater}90\%). This information will facilitate the design of transparent, conducting nanowire films for flexible displays, organic light emitting diodes and thin-film solar cells.},

The free energy of the volume Ω of an isotropic system is given by {NV}∫Ω[F(c)+0.5∊2{\textbar}∇c{\textbar}2]dx, where {NV}, c, F(c), ∊, and ∇c represent the number of molecules per unit volume, composition, free energy per molecule of a homogenous system, gradient energy coefficient related to the interfacial energy, and composition gradient, respectively. We define the chemical potential as the variational derivative of the total energy, and its flux as the minus gradient of the potential. Using the usual continuity equation, we obtain the Cahn–Hilliard equation. Second, we outline the mathematical derivation of the Cahn–Hilliard equation. The approach originates from the free energy functional and its justification of the functional in the Hilbert space. After calculating the gradient, we obtain the Cahn–Hilliard equation as a gradient flow.

A τ value of 1.5×10−9 was found to signify the onset of capillary instability induced failure in the {AgNW} {TCE} and from experimentally supported calculations, it was predicted that the lifetimes of nanowire {TCEs} under thermal degradation could be extended significantly by keeping the gaseous environment oxygen free.},

	abstract = {Flexible transparent electrodes employing metal nanowires ({NWs}) find extensive use in various applications such as optoelectronic devices, solar cells, light-emitting diodes, and transparent heaters. {NW} networks in flexible transparent electrodes can withstand mechanical deformations and conduct electricity but are susceptible to localized damage caused by mechanical stress and current density concentration. This localized damage ultimately results in electrode failure. Our study aims to track locally induced damage from both mechanical and electrical sources and assess their collective influence on electrode performance until failure occurs. To this end, we create two-dimensional digital samples that represent the {NW} networks, transform them into beam networks and equivalent resistor networks, and perform finite element simulations of the mechanical and electrical network responses while varying the {NW} content. Our simulations reveal crack-like patterns in the distribution of damaged elements at network failure that depend on the process inducing the damage. While our results suggest that the impact of electrically induced damage on overall network stability is more significant than that of mechanically induced damage, the latter must not be ignored.},

	abstract = {Numerical simulation of microstructure coarsening is a subject of great interest in computational materials science. The coarsening dynamics in a binary mixture can be modeled by the celebrated Cahn–Hilliard equations. To perform efficient and accurate long-time integrations, we develop a fast and stable high order numerical method for solving Cahn–Hilliard equations. The spatial discretization is carried out by the compact central difference scheme with {FFT}-based fast implementation while the time integration is done through the accurate exponential time differencing multistep approach. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by numerical experiments and study computationally the coarsening kinetics corresponding to different choices of the diffusion mobility.},
